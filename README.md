#Python SEED Servers

A python version of the [http://www.theseed.org/servers/](SEED servers). 


## The SEED servers

These servers provide programmatic access to the SEED and RAST environments and you can use them to submit jobs to RAST, view and retrieve your current jobs, as well as work within the SEED to retrieve annotations. 














# Source

These are automatically generated from the PERL .pm modules. We start with the pm2py.pl code (perl code that makes python), and then we add the header pieces and parts.

```
perl pm2py.pl SAP.pm > SAP.py
```

Edit `SAP.py` to include the appropriate header (in headers/SAP.py)
